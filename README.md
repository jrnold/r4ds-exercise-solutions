# Exercise Solutions to R for Data Science

These are solutions to the **1st edition** of R for Data Science. The solutions to the 2nd edition of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) are available at [R for Data Science (2e) - Solutions to Exercises](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/).

This repository contains the code and text behind the [Solutions for R for Data Science](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/), which, as its name suggests, has solutions to the the exercises in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

The R packages used in this book can be installed via
```r
devtools::install_github("jrnold/r4ds-exercise-solutions")
```
